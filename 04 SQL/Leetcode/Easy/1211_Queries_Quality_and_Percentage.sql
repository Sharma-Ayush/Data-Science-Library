1211. Queries Quality and Percentage

Table: Queries

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| query_name  | varchar |
| result      | varchar |
| position    | int     |
| rating      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
This table contains information collected from some queries on a database.
The position column has a value from 1 to 500.
The rating column has a value from 1 to 5. Query with rating less than 3 is a poor query.
 

We define query quality as:

The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.

We also define poor query percentage as:

The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.

Write an SQL query to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.

Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

Return the result table in any order.

--Schema:
Create table dbo.Queries (query_name varchar(30), result varchar(50), position int, rating int)
Truncate table Queries
insert into Queries (query_name, result, position, rating) values ('Dog', 'Golden Retriever', '1', '5')
insert into Queries (query_name, result, position, rating) values ('Dog', 'German Shepherd', '2', '5')
insert into Queries (query_name, result, position, rating) values ('Dog', 'Mule', '200', '1')
insert into Queries (query_name, result, position, rating) values ('Cat', 'Shirazi', '5', '2')
insert into Queries (query_name, result, position, rating) values ('Cat', 'Siamese', '3', '3')
insert into Queries (query_name, result, position, rating) values ('Cat', 'Sphynx', '7', '4')

--Solution:
Select query_name, 
	   ROUND(AVG(rating*1.0/position),2) as quality,
	   ROUND(SUM(case when rating < 3 then 1.00 else 0.00 end)*100/count(*),2) as poor_query_percentage
